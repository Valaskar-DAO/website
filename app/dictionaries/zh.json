    "q2": "什么是 Valaskar Passport？",
    "a2": "Valaskar Passport 是来自10,000件限量集合的 ERC-721 NFT。每个护照代表100×100网格上的特定土地，授予持有者链上管理控制权，并在 DAO 中提供1票治理投票权。每个护照还通过 Pioneer Rewards 归属获得75,000 VALA。",
    "q3": "什么是 VALA 代币？",
    "a3": "VALA 是固定、非通胀供应量为30亿的原生 ERC-20 代币。它作为游戏内货币，用于协议范围的支付、费用、土地入场、制作、市场交易和激励。VALA 不授予治理投票权——只有 Passport NFT 才能授予。",
    "q4": "治理如何运作？",
    "a4": "Valaskar 由护照持有者的 DAO 管理。每个 NFT 授予1票。提案需要25+护照的支持，随后是4小时延迟、2天投票期和24小时时间锁，然后才能执行。所有治理通过智能合约在链上强制执行。",
    "q5": "玩游戏需要加密货币吗？",
    "a5": "不需要。游戏设计了无摩擦的入门体验——不需要加密货币即可开始游戏。VALA 用于游戏内经济，但入口是免费的。Passport NFT 仅在您想要拥有和运营土地时才需要。",
    "q6": "土地所有者可以做什么？",
    "a6": "土地所有者对其土地内的内容、规则和游戏机制拥有完全控制权。这包括调整进度、资源/战利品率、PvP/PvE 规则、刷新逻辑、难度、变现和200多个可调参数。他们可以创建自定义游戏模式并将其土地作为独立产品发布。",
    "q7": "智能合约已上线吗？",
    "a7": "是的。核心智能合约已在以太坊主网上线，包括 VALA（ERC-20）、Valaskar Passport（ERC-721）、Governor、Timelock、Pioneer Vesting 和 Team Vesting。游戏本身仍在开发中。",
    "q8": "守护者的角色是什么？",
    "a8": "守护者是一个3/5团队多签，作为早期安全机制。它可以否决治理提案（除了替换守护者本身的提案）并管理某些 NFT 销售控制。它不能绕过时间锁、升级合约或将资金转移到任意地址。"

      "p1": "Valaskar is a decentralized, blockchain-based virtual world defined by a fixed set of 10,000 independent lands, each owned by a Valaskar Passport (NFT) holder. Each land is operated by its owner and can host gameplay and social interaction for players, with a maximum of 128 concurrent players per land. Land owners retain full control over gameplay rules, content, and monetization models. Land ownership and control are enforced on the blockchain, making cryptographically verifiable ownership.",
      "p2": "Early metaverse platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox did not reach mass-market adoption primarily because they never shipped a single, self-sustaining flagship game product comparable in engagement and retention to successful online games. Instead of one coherent game with a clear core gameplay loop, users got a fragmented mix of uneven experiences — walkthroughs and mini-games — resulting in inconsistent production quality and weak retention dynamics.",
      "p3": "This problem was further amplified by visual choices: a low-poly/voxel style can reduce appeal for parts of the adult audience, who often associate higher perceived value with stronger visual fidelity and production quality. This can lower conversion to regular play and limit mainstream retention.",
      "p4": "Valaskar takes a fundamentally different approach: the ecosystem is built around a flagship, AAA 3D survival game inspired by Rust/DayZ-style post-apocalyptic PvP, built as a standalone original title, and it serves as the main entry point with frictionless onboarding (no crypto needed to start). The game has a clear, repeatable gameplay loop with measurable progression, so players keep coming back for the gameplay."
