  "faq": {
    "tag": "FAQ",
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "What is Valaskar?",
    "a1": "Valaskar is a decentralized, blockchain-based virtual world consisting of 10,000 independent lands. Each land is owned by a Valaskar Passport (NFT) holder and can host gameplay for up to 128 concurrent players. The ecosystem is built around a flagship AAA 3D survival game inspired by Rust and DayZ.",
    "q2": "What is a Valaskar Passport?",
    "a2": "A Valaskar Passport is an ERC-721 NFT from a limited collection of 10,000 items. Each Passport represents one specific land on the 100×100 grid, grants on-chain administrative control to its holder, and provides 1 governance vote in the DAO. Each Passport also earns 75,000 VALA through Pioneer Rewards vesting.",
    "q3": "What is the VALA token?",
    "a3": "VALA is the native ERC-20 token with a fixed, non-inflationary supply of 3 billion. It serves as the in-game currency and is used for protocol-wide payments, fees, land entry, crafting, marketplace transactions, and incentives. VALA does not grant governance votes — only Passport NFTs do.",
    "q4": "How does governance work?",
    "a4": "Valaskar is governed by a DAO of Passport holders. Each NFT grants 1 vote. Proposals require backing by 25+ Passports, followed by a 4-hour delay, 2-day voting period, and 24-hour timelock before execution. All governance is enforced on-chain via smart contracts.",
    "q5": "Do I need crypto to play?",
    "a5": "No. The game is designed with frictionless onboarding — no crypto is needed to start playing. VALA is used for in-game economy, but the entry point is free. Owning a Passport NFT is only required if you want to own and operate a land.",
    "q6": "What can land owners do?",
    "a6": "Land owners have full control over content, rules, and gameplay mechanics within their land. This includes tuning progression, resource/loot rates, PvP/PvE rules, spawn logic, difficulty, monetization, and 200+ adjustable parameters. They can create custom game modes and publish their land as a standalone product.",
    "q7": "Are the smart contracts live?",
    "a7": "Yes. Core smart contracts are live on Ethereum mainnet, including VALA (ERC-20), Valaskar Passport (ERC-721), Governor, Timelock, Pioneer Vesting, and Team Vesting. The game itself is still under development.",
    "q8": "What is the Guardian role?",
    "a8": "The Guardian is a 3-of-5 team multisig that acts as an early-stage safety mechanism. It can veto governance proposals (except those that replace the Guardian itself) and manage certain NFT sale controls. It cannot bypass timelocks, upgrade contracts, or transfer funds to arbitrary addresses."
